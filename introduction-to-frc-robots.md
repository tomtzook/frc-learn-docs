Robots, by definition, come in so many forms and designs. This is very expected, as the design of the robot is directly influenced by its purpose. 
The same thing can be said about frc robots, however this is up to a limit. As FRC robots actually have many basic properties and design which are shared. So despite having many different teams working on robots, we will see quite a few similarities between the robots.
In FRC, robots are designed following the requirements for the specific competition/game they are meant to play. So many (if not all) of the decisions about how the robot is composed and what it can do and how are dictated but the game. 
Moreover, FRC teams typically follow very specific design concepts and philosphies to robot building and as such, familiarizing ourselves with these will allow us to understand how the robot functions and how it can be controlled and operated.

## Systems

We typically view as a set of different systems, which may or may not operate together. Each system plays a very specific role in the robot, and they function together as a whole to provide a complete capability. 

### Chassis

The base of each robot is the chassis, sometimes referred to as a _drive system_. This system plays to parts:
- provides a base for all the robot systems, which are placed on it.
- provides ground mobility, i.e. allowing the robot to move around on the floor.

The above is an example of a chassis. It is made up of a metal structure to hold the robot together and provide a structural support for placing things on top of it. The wheels allow this base to move around.

Most chassis designs are a rectangle metal structure, which provides a solid support for placing many things on it. As robots can weigh up to around 55 kg, so it must have a structure capable of supporting it. 
This structure may take several different variations, but the concept is the same.

The driving aspect of the chassis is also quite important, as an immobile robot is quite useless. There are several different configurations used in FRC to provide this mobility, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

#### Tank Drive

Tank-Drive chassis is a relatively simplistic, but robust design. It is capable of supporting a lot of weight while still being quite mobile.

A tank drive uses two sets of independently controlled wheels - one per side of the robot (right and left), with anywhere between 2-4 wheels per side. At its base, this drive configuration only allows forward or backward motion of each side of the robot,
limiting manovering capabilites (although at the hands of a good driver, this is fine). The wheels themselves are basic high-friction wheels.

Controlling this drive usually involves controlling each side independently and moving them forward or backwards. Moving both sides forwards or backwards will move the entire chassis forward or backward. Moving each side in a different direction will rotate the robot
in place. It is also possible to combine different powers and directions to each side to provide slightly more specific turning rates (e.g. moving both sides forward, but providing more power to the left side will result in a slight turn to the right).
