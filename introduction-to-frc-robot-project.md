## Retreiving Template

Because creating a robot project is a bit complex, and Intellij does not provide this capability in its project creator, we use a pre-made template which is fully configured and ready to use.
As such, to open a new robot project, one needs to download this template and open it.

Open [this page](https://github.com/Flash3388/Frc-Robot-Template). 

Click on the green _Code_ button.

This will open a menu, click on _Download Zip_

![download zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efd7de12-e3fc-45c8-968d-d90ab8cd7fb0)

This will download a `.zip` file with the template. Once the download has finished, open the file and extract the folder inside
to a location of your choosing on the computer.

It is recommended to create a specialized folder for all your robot project in a location you will remember. It is also recommended to rename
the extract folder to something unique, so you could easily understand what it is. This name typically should reference what robot you are working on.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not place these folders under OneDrive if you have one. This will fuck up the project files.

Once the folder was placed, open _Intellij_ and open this new project via _File->Open_. This will open a folder selection dialog, navigate to the folder you extracted, select it and click _Ok_ to open the project.

> [!NOTE]
> For newer intellj versions, this _File_ menu is hidden. Click on the Hamburger button on the top left to show it.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you are selecting the folder you extracted and not a part of it or the folder containing it.

Once selected, the project will start loading. This may take a few minutes. You will notice a loading bar in the bottom of Intellij.
Let it finish before using the project.

## Robot Project Structure

As you can see, even an _empty_ robot project is packed with many things.
