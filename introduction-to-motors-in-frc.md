Motors provide FRC robots with force and motion. They are the base for designing most systems and are pretty reliable and not to complicated to use.

## DC Motors

FRC robots are limited to use DC (Direct Current) motors. Such motors are operated by providing Direct Current from a power source. 
This is enforced by the game rules. In fact, the game rules only allow using specific motors verified by FIRST. 

Legal motors can typically rotate up to 5800 RPM and provide a max of around 2.4 Nm. This is more than sufficent for robots. The selection of a specific
motor is very dependent on system requirement, funds, control requirments and such. So we will see a combination of different motors on a robot.

Normally, a motor will be used by connecting its output shaft (the rotating part) to a bigger shaft/axle which causes a rotation of some mechanism. This may be a wheel,
a shaft mounting some arm, or more. Regardless, motors always produce a rotation motion and this may be used for rotating mechanisms, or converted for linear motion.

DC motors are built on the concepts on magnets and magnetic fields. By passing a Direct Current through coils, a magnetic field is generated and pulls/pushes on magnets. This creates a rotation motion.
There are 2 derivatives to this design: Brushed and Brushless; Each is a bit different, but uses the same basic principles.
